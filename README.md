# DWD-Proxy API

RESTful API to dynamically query DWD climate data from public FTP Servers.
## Overview
This Project is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET data form (Deutsche Wetter Dienst) FTP server.

It is an implementation based on representational state transfer (REST) technology,Which is an architectural style and approach to communications often used in web services development.  

This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This Project uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask, Connexion is a framework on top of Flask_ to automagically handle your REST API requests
based on `Swagger 2.0 Specification`_ files in YAML. 
And [uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as the web server for the usage in cluster.
For production systems the traffic to be routed through [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/docs/).
